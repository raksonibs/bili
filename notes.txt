ex:
He estado recordando los momentos que te di, (8 words)
Cuántos tu me diste y porque ahora estoy aquí, 
Sentada en el suelo pensando que te quiero,

I've been remembering the moments that I gave to you, (10 words)
How many you gave to me and why I'm now here, 
Sat on the floor thinking that I love you, 

// highlighting (he or I've) shoudl give you the respective other. of course this is never a full match, but it could be a possible solution. because sentence structure is always different, maybe the best estimate I can do here is give an approximate word. (research math of word matching, see if something like this already exists, or just give a straight up dictionary definition)

The sentence is much easier, as can just show that entire sentence.

- mvp:
  - books, articles, songs
  - pay for books (each book is one dollar) //everything might need to be free, what are the legal issues of scraping this content. I probably can't get someone to pay for it when it isn't my own nor do I owe it. if I refer people to the original book, that can be possible. 
  - I think mvp will have everything free, hosting the content on my own is obviously pretty problematic. If I source, is that okay?

-> need to get content, at least update of new articles (or all old ones because no copyright)
-> at least ten songs,
-> at least three books!
-> no need to buidl scrapper if no use
-> language shower built on 2.0
-> style

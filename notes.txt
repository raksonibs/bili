ex:
He estado recordando los momentos que te di, (8 words)
Cuántos tu me diste y porque ahora estoy aquí, 
Sentada en el suelo pensando que te quiero,

I've been remembering the moments that I gave to you, (10 words)
How many you gave to me and why I'm now here, 
Sat on the floor thinking that I love you, 

// highlighting (he or I've) shoudl give you the respective other. of course this is never a full match, but it could be a possible solution. because sentence structure is always different, maybe the best estimate I can do here is give an approximate word. (research math of word matching, see if something like this already exists, or just give a straight up dictionary definition)

The sentence is much easier, as can just show that entire sentence.
